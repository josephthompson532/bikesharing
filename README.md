## Purpose
The purpose of this repository was to analyze whether expanding citibike, a bike-sharing service, from New York to Des Moines is a viable business venture.

### Overview
To do this, I analyzed New York City data from Citibike using Tableau. The most relevant metrics reviewed were breakdowns of users themselves in relation to the count of rides along lines of gender, times of use, age, and area where the bikes were used. I elucidated these breakdowns in worksheets that i then consolidated into a Tableau story.

## Results
The results show that users are predominantly male that are subscribers to Citibike. Furthermore, there are discrepencies depending on time of the week. During weekdays, rides are generally during the early morning and evening coinciding with the times people go to and from work. This suggests people are using citibike to commute. This information can be used to analyze Des Moines viability. If bikes are placed in a area with a high level of local commuting, its possible people will use Citibike! It should be local because the "Checkout Times by Gender graph shows that users tend to use the bikes less and less as trip durations exceed 5 mins. During the weekends, rides are more evenly spread out throughout the day. The excess of male users may also suggest further efforts should be made to make citibike more appealing for a female audience to bridge this gap.

## Summary
In conclusion, given that Des Moines is a relatively small city and not a rural area, it is likely the case that there is a sizable portion of the populace that are open to riding bikes to work.
